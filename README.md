Hello, my name is João Vinícius Guerber de Souza, I have a degree in Systems Analysis and development and I am currently a front-end and mobile developer.

Over the last three years I have dedicated myself to developing web and mobile applications using JavaScript and TypeScript, focusing on the ReactJS and React Native frameworks. During these three years I was also on projects that used Angular and Ionic. I have used many libraries and tools and have vast knowledge in these technologies. In my career I have developed a variety of commercial applications such as applications for Fintech, financial markets, education, fitness, health. Currently I have been studying design patterns and software architecture.

I have an advanced intermediate level of English, I am able to speak, listen and write, therefore, communicate.
